## üöß **Course Structure**


The challenge is structured to provide both asynchronous and synchronous learning paths, allowing you to learn at your own pace or collaborate with others through live sessions.


### **Frontend Focus Areas:**
- **Responsive Design**: Master the use of **media queries** and **flexbox/grid** to build websites that work across devices.
- **JavaScript Interactivity**: Learn how to create dynamic elements using **vanilla JavaScript**.
- **Version Control**: Get comfortable using **Git** and **GitHub** for managing your projects and collaboration.


### **Backend Focus Areas:**
- **Server-Side Development**: Build and deploy backends using **Node.js** and **Express**.
- **Database Management**: Understand how to set up and manage a **MongoDB** database for storing user data.
- **API Development**: Create RESTful APIs for seamless frontend-backend communication.
- **Authentication & Security**: Implement user authentication and secure your application with best practices.

## üìö **Learning Tracks**


You can choose between two learning modes based on your preference:


### **Asynchronous Track**:
- **Work at Your Own Pace**: Access all the learning materials, projects, and resources to progress through the challenge independently.
- **Documentation & Resources**: Explore [detailed resources](./Documentation/README.md) provided in the **Documentation** folder, including tutorials, articles, and code samples to help you at every stage of development.
 
### **Synchronous Track**:
- **Live Coding Sessions**: Attend live coding sessions and workshops via **Microsoft Teams** for interactive learning with real-time feedback. Participate in Q&A sessions, coding challenges, and peer reviews.
- **Study Groups**: Collaborate with fellow learners in group study sessions to share knowledge and solve coding challenges together.

## üèÜ **Certification Pathways**
As you progress through the challenge, completing key projects will unlock the opportunity to earn certifications that demonstrate your skills in web development. Here's what you need to know:


### Frontend Developer Certification:
- Complete the required frontend projects, including building a responsive portfolio, interactive web pages, and working with JavaScript.
### Backend Developer Certification:
- Complete backend-focused projects, like building a RESTful API, handling data with MongoDB, and implementing authentication with **JWT** or **OAuth**.
### Full Stack Developer Certification:
- Complete both frontend and backend tracks to earn this certification. You'll have built full-stack applications that demonstrate your ability to handle both the client-side and server-side logic.


Once you've completed all required projects in either the frontend, backend, or both, you'll be eligible to receive a certificate that you can showcase on your portfolio, LinkedIn, or resume.
